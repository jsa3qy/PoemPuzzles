So
all
their
prais es
are
but
proph e cies
Of
this
our
time,
all
you
pre fig ur ing;
And,
for
they
lookâ€™d
but
with
div in ing
eyes,
They
had
not
skill
e nough
your
worth
to
sing:
For
we,
which
now
be
hold
these
pre sent
days,
Had
eyes
to
won der,
but
lack
tongues
to
praise.
