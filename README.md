# PoemPuzzles
Repo for code related to puzzle poetry research

Hi all!

In the master branch are two files: api and front-end

api: includes the back-end code for this Sonnet Tiling App!
front-end: includes all front end infrastructure for the app

how to get started running this locally:
1) clone repo 
2) install dependencies 
3) ./run.sh

Notes:
- We have not had success running this on a Windows machine, so OS X or other Unix based OSes are preferred for this reason
